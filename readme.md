# Setup
Create a `.env` file with the following variables to establish a database connection:
```
SERVER=   "localhost"
DB_NAME=  "your_db_name"
USERNAME= "your_username"
PASSWORD= "your_password"
```

Run the `/scripts/create_database.php` script to create the database and load the data for the first time.

Ensure that PHP and Apache is set up on your local computer and you should be good to go!
